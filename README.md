# Final Year Project - Controllo

This is a group project during final year during my undergradute. The project comprises of an android application and microcontroller Arduino to help motor disabled people in controlling the room appliances using their facial gestures. In order to run the project, you will need to install Android Studio ( https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and have access to Arduino (https://www.arduino.cc/) The code for application and Arduino is available in the git repository along with documentation that would thoroughly explain the project.

Android application uses Android Vision API for detecting the facial landmarks. Our model processes the landmarks and sends corresponding signal to Arduino Uno that in turns operates the switches of room appliances.

# Appliances Controlled

Light: On/off,
Fan: On/Off,
Television: On/Off, Volume up/down, Channel up/down
